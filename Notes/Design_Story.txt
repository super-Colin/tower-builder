I am Legion, for we are many



Plot Outline:
  Beginning - You are a Goobot, a single (or small collective of) self replicating nanobot [Grey Goo Event basically]
    - Sent out in all directions in the universe from some unknown entity

  As you grow you begin to gain consciousness as the "Hive mind" that influences the goo as a whole
    - This is never stated out loud
    - It is displayed by changing labels like Goobots to Children
    - It could introduce a "Hunger" meter (maybe this is just a visualization of their growth vs. death rate?)
    - All the resource names could taker on these more personal labels
    - These changes should slowly fade in/out
  The next jump in "intelligence" happens, or begins after some influence from space
    [
      Meteors begin to land on the planet more and more often 
      A special meteor lands and is eaten by the Goo
      - Could/Should be different looking
    ][
      It could be a probe from another unknown entity that is trying to communicate
      This trigger may also come from hearing a signal through a radio tower
       - It could be tied to building your first or second radio tower
    ]
  This new intelligence opens up new mechanics
  Allows you to begin actively searching the stars with radio towers
    - ?Opens up an unlock an unlock tree?
    - ?Opens research points?
  The gooMind Desires to know more about the universe (?home?)
  At this point you must begin researching to dig deeper into the planet / progress somehow
  The Other begins to actively fight your consumption of the planet
    - their creation of material helps to feed your consumption of material
  (You will have to have encountered The Other at this point)
  At some point you hit enough research to begin launching satellites into orbit
  Once you have enough self-sustatianing satellites The Other begins to eat the planet as well
    - Maybe it starts trying to destroy your towers?
    - It is still generating more goo from passive / environmental energy sources
    - 
  the end game begins
  (You will have to have begun to overtake The Other at this point)





  Ending - You build a huge radar dish to reach out to and hear from deep space
    - Best Ending: If you are able to combine with the other entity?
      - It may feel like a war, but it can be resolved without extinction of either
        - If you can manage to balance your destruction with their creation you can live in harmony
    - Good Ending: When you have consumed enough of the planet to finish the planetary radio
    - Bad Ending: When you have consumed the planet without enough material to build the planetary Radio Tower
    - Joke Ending: When you manage to die before making the final tower
    - Shouldn't be too obvious that there are different endings... but a hint somewhere would be good (Get all endings achievo?)
  




Almost all of the narrative will be implied
  - UI labels / look changing through the phases
    - towards a more organic feel ?Or a robotic feel?
  - The story begins with your UI changing
  - It continues to be told through the research tree
    - Things like "interstellar ear" and ""...








The other entity is basically your opposite
  - creation vs destruction
  - You create energy by consuming matter, it creates matter from energy
  - It may try to fight against you somehow 
    - Try to prevent or slow your progress
    - Making a regenerating border you have to be able to consume fast enough
  It the ultimate ending will be if you can combine with the other

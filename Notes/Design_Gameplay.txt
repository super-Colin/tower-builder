High Level:
  - Player must balance building more bots quickly (factories) against the power cost (which can cost bots)
  - It is possible to get a game over, although difficult. 
    - The goo will try to survive through the game's built in mechanics, as a sort of "self preservation"






First 1 Minute of Gameplay:
  -? Choice of bonus? (Just hold down the mouse? ...???)
    - Evolution path or just a "race"/origin type flat bonus?





UI:
  Menu could be center of the planet you start on?
    - shows the progression of your save
  - Don't want to break the scale so maybe it's just focused on the edge of your progress into the planet

High Level Gameplay Overview

First 1 Minute of Gameplay:
  Main menu is a start and an options button 
    - Comet/flaming projectile flying through space, in the background under the buttons
    - Starting a new game will make the menu buttons fade away as the comet crashes onto the planet surface
  Game starts with you seeing a small speckle that begins to grow
  After a few moments you can click on the planet around the speckle to make it expand more quickly
  Once the speckle has grown slightly larger a resource display of some kind appears
    - This could be a bar that will change to a number later
--- End of 1 minute mark
  Eventualy a brick will appear
    - a pile of material could slowly build up
      - The pile could also be the brick being slowly built up
  This will start a new counter
    - It may also unlock a bar for progress toward the next brick
  The bricks will slowly build up on automatically at this point
  There will be introduced a button that can speed up the placement of bricks
    - This may be an outline or transparent sprite of the next brick to be placed
      - Probably take more than 1 click to create the brick
--- End of 5/10 minute mark
  After enough bricks have been piled up you will have finished your first tower
  This will start a new tower that uses larger bricks and ends up higher
  After 1-2 towers you can begin to turn bricks into low level useful buildings
    - This is where you'll be able to start increasing your new bot output and brick creation speed
=== End of Phase 1 - So small... : from the start until you carve your first building into a brick 
--- End of 1 hour mark
  When your production reaches a certain amount you can begin building research related buildings
=== End of Phase 2 Self aware : from your first building until you unlock your first research node
  Your first research point will unlock a research tree (certain things could be randomized?) 
  The first major research will unlock the power system and related buildings
    - This will include powered versions of the previous low-tech buildings
  After building your first generator a new research node is available for radio observations
  Generators will consume your material production to produce power
    - Solar panels will be the only "renewable" source of energy and will be very expensive
    - You can use power to increase your goo production and thus your material production in the end
  Now thigs are beginning to scale faster
    - Numbers are getting bigger, difference in height between towers is growing, camera is zooming out furthur
=== End of Phase 3 - Industry : from first research to constructing a radio dish
--- End of 3 hour mark
  After building up enough radio/space observation you unlock a new research node (Space Science)
    - You can begin to launch satellites
      - Satellites help scale your research
  Your first satellite triggers a probe from The Other that lands on the surface
    - This should be visible and obvious
    - Clicking on it to "understand" is required to progress
      - May take multiple clicks
      - Can also 
    - If left for too long it will be slowly eaten 
      - Without getting the bonus research points
    - If you don't activate it with clicks another will land 
=== End of Phase 4 - The Other : from first buildings until first satellite launch
  After learning from the probe you can begin atively sending signals into space
    - sparks knowledge of deep space
    - probably costs lots of power
  Another probe lands, but it cannot be destroyed
--- End of 5/6 hour mark
  It extends it's own radio dish/tower
    - 
=== End of Phase 5 - Aggression : from first probe landing to when it begins fighting your progress
  Then it begins creating it's own goo
    - Unike your goo it creates material
      - Maybe it encases itself in material to toughen it
      - Maybe it builds a small mountain range around itself
  The new goo begins to fight your progress
    - It produces material at the edge of your consumption into the planet
      - This slows down your progress into the planet
      - It also provides an infinite supply of material
  You must continue to increase your production to keep up and not be "encased"
    - it will attempt to encase you in a wall that you cannot eat through 
      - causing a game over, ideally you can reload a recent auto save
  You must overtake the probe that was the source of the new goo
    - You can eat it
    - Or you can spare it somehow
=== End of Phase 6 - Victory? : From the point of "aggression" to overtaking The Other's probe
  This unlocks the planetary radio research node
--- End of 7/8 hour mark
  With the other goo no longer providing infinite material you continue into the planet
  Now you must work toward the planetary radio before the planet is completely eaten
    - Otherwise your active goobots will die out and not be able to create more
=== End of Phase 7 - The Signal : Starts at the completion of the PRadio
  Once completed you must supply it with a HUGE amount of power for a certain amount of time
  Completing the PRadio and sending the signal with completely passive energy is the best ending
    - Investing in solar panels early will help not eat the planet as fast
    - The mind falls asleep, waiting to be re-awoken
  Completing the PRadio and sending the signal is best ending!
    - Investing in solar panels early will help not eat the planet as fast
    - The mind falls asleep, waiting to be re-awoken
  Completing the PRadio is a win
    - The goo may die, but the monument lives on!
  Failing to complete the PRadio is still a win
    - The worst ending
    - The Hive mind is sated, but slowly fades away
=== End of Phase 8 - The End? : The planet is consumed and the Signal is either sent or not... but the planet is still/silent
--- End of 8/10 hour mark
--- End of game
------ Roll credit...

Breaking that down into phases:

Phase 1 - So small... : from the start until you carve your first building into a brick 
Phase 2 - Self aware : from your first building until you unlock your first research node
Phase 3 - Industry : from first research to constructing a radio dish
Phase 4 - The Other : from first buildings until first satellite launch
Phase 5 - Aggression : from first probe landing to when it begins fighting your progress
Phase 6 - Victory? : From the point of "aggression" to overtaking The Other's probe
Phase 7 - The Signal : Starts at the completion of the PRadio
Phase 8 - The End? : The planet is consumed and the Signal is either sent or not... but the planet is still














Maybe beating the game unlocks tower builder 1 in the menu?
  - Some terrible looking game with a very short gameplay loop?







UI:
  Menu could be center of the planet you start on?
    - shows the progression of your save
  - Don't want to break the scale so maybe it's just focused on the edge of your progress into the planet
  Maybe build the UI counters into the bricks as buildings?
  Visual feedback of progress while being clicked is very important

















  - It is possible to get a game over, although difficult. 
    - The goo will try to survive through the game's built in mechanics, as a sort of "self preservation"






  Start menu is a comet/flaming projectile in the background
    - The only things to click here are start and options
    - If the computer has a save file on it the start menu will have the current goo in the background (basically on auto play)
  Game starts: 
  -? Choice of bonus? (Just hold down the mouse? ...???)
    - Evolution path or just a "race"/origin type flat bonus?

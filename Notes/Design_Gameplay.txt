High Level:
  - Player must balance building more bots quickly (factories) against the power cost (which can cost bots)
  - It is possible to get a game over, although difficult. 
    - The goo will try to survive through the game's built in mechanics, as a sort of "self preservation"






First 1 Minute of Gameplay:
  Main menu is a start and an options button 
    - Comet/flaming projectile flying through space, in the background under the buttons
    - Starting a new game will make the menu buttons fade away as the comet crashes onto the planet surface
  Game starts with you seeing a small speckle that begins to grow
  After a few moments you can click on the planet around the speckle to make it expand more quickly
  Once the speckle has grown slightly larger a resource display of some kind appears
    - This could be a bar that will change to a number later,
--- End of 1 minute mark
  Eventualy a brick will appear
    - a pile of material could slowly build up
      - The pile could also be the brick being slowly built up
  This will start a new counter
    - It may also unlock a bar for progress toward the next brick
  The bricks will slowly build up on automatically at this point
  There will be introduced a button that can speed up the placement of bricks
    - This may be an outline or transparent sprite of the next brick to be placed
      - Probably take more than 1 click to create the brick
--- End of 5/10 minute mark
  After enough bricks have been piled up you will have finished your first tower
  This will start a new tower that uses larger bricks and ends up higher
  After 1-2 towers you can begin to turn bricks into low level useful buildings
    - This is where you'll be able to start increasing your new bot output and brick creation speed
--- End of 1 hour mark
  When your production reaches a certain amount you can begin building research related buildings
  Your first research point will unlock a research tree (certain things could be randomized?) 
  The first major research will unlock the power system and related buildings
    - This will include powered versions of the previous low-tech buildings
  After building your first generator a new research node is available for radio observations
  Generators will consume your material production to produce power
    - You can use power to increase your goo production and thus your material production in the end
  Now thigs are beginning to scale faster
    - Numbers are getting bigger, difference in height between towers is growing, camera is zooming out furthur
--- End of 3 hour mark
  After building up enough radio/space observation you unlock a new research node (Space Science)
    - You can begin to launch satellites
      - Satellites help scale your research
  Your first satellite triggers a probe from The Other that lands on the surface
    - This should be visible and obvious
    - Clicking on it to "understand" is required to progress
      - May take multiple clicks
      - Can also 
    - If left for too long it will be slowly eaten 
      - Without getting the bonus research points
    - If you don't activate it with clicks another will land 
  After learning from the probe you can begin atively sending signals into space
    - sparks knowledge of deep space
    - probably costs lots of power
  Another probe lands, but it cannot be destroyed
--- End of 5/6 hour mark
  It extends it's own radio dish/tower
    - 
  Then it begins creating it's own goo
    - Unike your goo it creates material
      - Maybe it builds a mountain around itself 




UI:
  Menu could be center of the planet you start on?
    - shows the progression of your save
  - Don't want to break the scale so maybe it's just focused on the edge of your progress into the planet
  Maybe build the UI counters into the bricks as buildings?
  Visual feedback of progress while being clicked is very important






Gameplay:

















  Start menu is a comet/flaming projectile in the background
    - The only things to click here are start and options
    - If the computer has a save file on it the start menu will have the current goo in the background (basically on auto play)
  Game starts: 
  -? Choice of bonus? (Just hold down the mouse? ...???)
    - Evolution path or just a "race"/origin type flat bonus?

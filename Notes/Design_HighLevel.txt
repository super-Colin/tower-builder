1 Day Expected
Took:
  2 Work Days
    - Very worth the extra day
  0 Full Days
  


Gameplay:
  You start by seeing watching the ground slowly being turned gray in a slowly expanding radius under you
  Shortly after you'll have enough material to start adding bricks to your first tower
  Once you've built a few layers on your first tower you'll be able to start a new tower that will use bigger bricks
  The new tower will have bigger bricks which will let it reach higher with the same number of layers
  Rinse and repeat for a few towers




Theme / Context / Story:
  You are the hive mind behind the gray goo
    "So hungry... must eat"
  After the first few towers, you see that you are just reaching the top of some blades of grass and how small you're starting
  The hivemind grows smarter







Mechanics:
  Build a tower higher and higher
  At a certain height you can start a new larger tower
  When you've built a large enough tower you win (possibly restart with a bigger tower requirement [..Meta progression?])


Dynamics:
  You begin with the only means of progression being to click to collect resources
  Building your tower higher allows you to gain resources at a faster rate
  At some point you are able to spend gathered resource to begin auto-clicking
  ?? New mechanics unlock with each new tower ??


Aesthetics:
  Submission (pastime)
  Sensation (beautiful background scenary, sense of growth)
  
  Starting from smaller than a blade of grass each tower scales up and eventually end up bigger than a city
  Clicking advances the goo's progression eating the planet

Tower Builder


player experience goals:
  Relaxing / Mindless, 
  Feeling of continous progress,
  Feeling small from increasing scale 


Project Goals:
  Create a polished game by the end of the year
  Create a game that I am proud of
  Create a game that can be sold on Steam
  Create a game that I enjoy
  Create a game that is pleasing to the eye (to me)
  Prove to myself that I can make an MVP close to what I envision by knowing what is in scope


Game World:
  Something in the distance of space has created a grey goo technology that has been sent across the universe
  You are the "Hive mind" that influences the behavior of a network of connected nano-bots/goo-bots
  The connections start on the planet that you've landed on until you can devour the planet and create a tower/satellite/radio tower to reach other goo-ed planets
  The hive mind becomes smarter as it grows
  The graphics are pixelated with brighter (happier) colors
    ? Against a subtle, dark under tone that you are the villian


Mechanics:
  Clicking a lot on a main thing
  Automating the clicking
  Waiting for the automated clicking to build up enough resources to unlock the next mechanic
  New mechanics add complexity and difficulty
  Win Condition: When your tower has reached an arbitrary height
  New Game+ : Move to another planet

  More Depth:
    The main thing that will be available to click from the start is (the planet below your goo-feet/)
    The first upgrade that automates clicking is (the goo developing the conscious hive mind)
    After some time digging into the planet you'll realize you can't make more goo faster than you can dig and build up material
      - Maybe a small pile builds up? 
      - A button appears to place a block
      - This will start a new (the first) resource counter for the total material mass you have stored in all blocks = 1 at this point
      - Before you know it, you're building a tower
    More time.. You can now spend the unproccessed material to...
    ??Tower Defense?? - At some point you begin being attacked?


    
    The first upgrade that speeds up clicking is using the stored to build more
      - The upgrades will be placed into the prevously placed block (If they could click one that would be cool -- hovering over could show the price of it on the tower based on it's scale)
    The first upgrade that speeds up clicking is (the goo learning to work together more)

Resources:
  GooBots:
    - These are the most basic "resource",
    - The amount of nano bots eating away at the planet
    - There is a constant creating and destroying bots
        - (run out of battery?-throw into a furnace?)
            - If throwing into a furnace, are the dead bots a resource?
    - If these are depleted you probably lose
  Knowledge? / Evolution Points? (Meta progression unlock tree)
    - for research?
  Research? different unlock tree than Knowledge  
    - for research?
  Unproccessed / Raw material
    - A uniform material byproduct from consuming the planet
    - Stored in the tower bricks
    - From eating the planet
    - For creating upgrades
  Electricity / Energ
    - needed by the end for 
    - The goo overheats itself to produce energy (Furnace?) 
    - Solar panels
  Radio Strength
    - The distance that your radio towers can reach into space
    - Increases research rate (probably scales with bricks)



Buildings/Upgrades:
  Factory / Nest / 
    - Too accelerate the rate you can produce more goo
    - Consumes power
  Hive Mind Tuner/Enhancer | Thought Purifier/Distiller
    - Generate knowledge points
  Furnace/
    - Make electrity / Produce energy
  Power lines?
    - Spread power to other towers/bricks/ further away bricks
  Radio Station
    - Generates / increases radio strength
  Satellites? as another type of radio station
  ??Tower Defense?? - Turrets?

  

Systems:
  Save / Load:
    - Save and Load will be required for an idle game like this
    - Probably should implement an autosave feature
  GooBots:
    - These will eat into the planet and produce material/bricks
    - Bots that are eating are also creating new bots
    - Bots die off after so long
    - If they are unable to keep producing new GooBots faster than they die it will be a game over
  Resources:
    - Used to create and maintain upgrades, listed above
  Power:
    Generators:
      - Produce Power
      - Can power buildings in directly touching bricks
      - Adds to the continously reducing total bots
      - Can be turned off? Will turn off automatically if needed to survive?
    Power Lines:
      - Can spread power to further away buildings (and towers?)
    Consumers:
      - Things that will put a burden on electrical out put (other buildings etc)
  Bricks / Towers:
    Bricks are a visual indication of how much material you have stored
      - As Bricks are created they will be placed on top of each other to create a tower
        - Using material will consume the blocks in your towers
      - After a tower has reached a certain height you can start a new bigger tower
        - Each new tower will increase in scale creating bigger towers with the same amount of bricks
  Buildings / Upgrades:
    - Uses GooBots to carve useful buildings into the stored unproccessed material bricks
    - It costs goobos and takes time to make buildings
  Radio Signals:
    - Used to survey the sky and to reach other planets / ?predict and collect resources from meteors? / ?Some kind of gift?
    - Adds a continous research bonus
    - Created and added to by radio stations
    Planetary Radio:
      - The final step in reaching to another planet (the last largest tower you build *should* be this if you've planned well enough)
  Unlock Trees:
    - These will unlock new game mechanics and UI elements (based on a choice at the start?)
  ?Different Starting Bot Types?:
    - Some are more effecient making power, one lives longer, one digs faster?
      --- Leads to a Stat system..





Good Ending / Bad Ending? (is it an obvious choice?) 
  - Good Ending: When you have consumed the enough of the planet to finish the planetary radio
  - Bad Ending: When you have consumed the planet without building the planetary Radio Tower(Bad)
  - Joke Ending: When you manage to die before making the final tower
    - Shouldn't be too obvious that there is different endings... but a hint would be good


  ------ If there is a sequel it can pick up from here being able to use a radio dish the size the planet... and expand to a radio dish the size of the solar system
    ------ If there is a sequel to the sequel it can pick up from there being able to reach new galaxies (solar sails??)
    - It would be super cool if the sequel could see how you ended the previous game through a save file flag
    



Do you need to become sentient before placing your first block?





















Goobos?
